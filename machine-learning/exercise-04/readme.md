# Exercise 4

This exercise introduces classical machine learning algorithms for classification tasks (0R, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, k-NN, decision tree, random forest) and their implementations in the scikit-learn library. The algorithms are trained and tested on a 2D synthetic dataset to produce visualizations and build intuition about their behavior.

Check the official scikit-learn documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html.
