Since we are dealing with a binary classification problem and the network’s output is a probability (we end the network with a single-unit layer and a sigmoid activation), it is best to use the `binary_crossentropy` loss function. This is not the only viable choice: you could use, for example, `mean_squared_error`. But crossentropy is usually the best choice when working with models that output probabilities.

        "As you can see, training loss decreases with each epoch and training accuracy increases with each epoch. This is what you would expect when running gradient descent optimization — the quantity you are trying to minimize should decrease with each iteration. But this is not the case for validation loss and accuracy: they appear to peak at the fourth epoch. This is an example of what we warned about earlier: a model that performs better on the training data is not necessarily the model that will perform better on data it has never seen before. More precisely, what you are seeing is overfitting: after the second epoch we are over-optimizing on the training data and end up learning representations that are specific to the training set and do not generalize to data outside the training set.\n",

        "\n",
