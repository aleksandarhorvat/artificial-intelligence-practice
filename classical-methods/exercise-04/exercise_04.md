Implement the informed search algorithms (GBFS and A*) to solve the Romania cities problem. Define an appropriate heuristic function (the same one will be used by both algorithms) and implement it

A map of Romania is provided (image below), where the cities are represented as nodes and the roads between them as edges, with the weight of each edge representing the distance between the cities.
The search begins in the city of Arad, and the goal city is Bucharest.
Run the informed search algorithms and print the list of actions that lead the agent from the start city to the goal city.
Compare the resulting paths and their optimality in terms of total distance and path cost.

The city connections and the straight-line distances from each city to Bucharest are provided in the files: city_connections.txt and straight_line_distances.txt.
