# Exercise 4

This exercise continues exploring pandas and introduces basic data visualization using the seaborn library.

Most content for these exercises is taken from the [Kaggle Learn pandas tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) and the [Kaggle Learn data visualization tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization).
